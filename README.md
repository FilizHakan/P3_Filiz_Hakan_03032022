Case Study : Project Ohmyfood

The outline : I work as a junior front-end at Ohmyfood, a young startup that would like to launch their website in the hospitality industry. To do so, the startup's main objective is to create a mobile first website which enlists menus from gastronomic restaurants. Customers will not only be allowed to book in a classical way, but will also have the option to select their menus beforehand directly from the website. The new startup hopes that with the mobile friendly website, the waiting time for dinning in their restaurants will be considerably decreased, if not, vanished.

Objectives : Create a mobile first website application Implement advanced CSS effects and navigation structure on a mobile first website
